This is my personal website! It typically involves new frameworks I am trying to learn or test content. 
Currently, I am looking into full stack development via Meteor, then expanding this into solidified knowledge with JavaScript, then JQuery by extension. 

This site is constantly changing since I am always trying to find other interesting features to add on, so I would love to hear about potential ideas you may have. 

Currently for content, I have been considering three main aspects.

1. Resume and general qualifications, for the goal of getting an internship or job. 
2. Interests with relations to Computer Science. 
3. Daily Life

Technologies I plan to implement in this:

1. Masonry: http://www.websterhall.com/timeline/
2. Isotope [sorting]
3. Materialize 
4. Meteor
5. Timeline https://www.technotarek.com/timeliner/
