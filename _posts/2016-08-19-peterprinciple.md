## Overview
Throughout my time at Teradata, I reached out to other employees in hopes of learning from their perspectives. Here's some lessons I learned from each.

## Daniel Hoffman - Software Engineering Manager
I reached out to Daniel after he and several other managers held a Q&A session for interns. He first hosted a luncheon along with several other managers on a smaller scale,
then a private lunch with me. Throughout, I learned several important aspects of working towards a managerial position. To start off, most majors allow you to graduate then
immediately begin work in your field of choice. Unfortunately, nobody really wants a new college grad manager. In order to combat this, he recommended two main tracks. The first
is to assume a project management role, then leverage a technical background into technical management. The alternative is to work as a software engineer then transition to
a architectural role while beginning to delegate tasks to others. 

On the way back, he told me to look into the Peter Principle, which states

> People rise to their level of incompetence

The idea behind this is that people often look at who does well in their role for promotions. However as burdens increase, people become unable to perform at their current level
and no longer get promoted. At this level, they tend to fail which is why people seem to be inadequate for their roles.

> In order to put yourself in position for a role you want, you need to excel in the role you don't yet have... not only the one you're currently in - Daniel Hoffman

He also introduced me to the daily life of managers. As a software engineer, my typical day consists of taking issues that have been assigned to me and working them through.
I have complete control over when to work on what, and am solely responsible for my own performance. Meetings take a relatively small portion of my time. On the contrary for
a manager, his days are typically filled with meetings, scheduling and preparing for meetings, finding methods to redelegate tasks and leverage supply/demand of his team's time 
vs. what other teams want. He stressed the importance of simultaneously serving as a buffer for the team so they can work efficiently, and removing blockers for his team members
to proceed as efficiently as possible.
