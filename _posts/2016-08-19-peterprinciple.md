## Overview
Throughout my time at Teradata, I reached out to other employees in hopes of learning from their perspectives. Here's some lessons I learned from each.

## Daniel Hoffman - Software Engineering Manager
I reached out to Daniel after he and several other managers held a Q&A session for interns. He first hosted a luncheon along with several other managers on a smaller scale,
then a private lunch with me. Throughout, I learned several important aspects of working towards a managerial position. To start off, most majors allow you to graduate then
immediately begin work in your field of choice. Unfortunately, nobody really wants a new college grad manager. In order to combat this, he recommended two main tracks. The first
is to assume a project management role, then leverage a technical background into technical management. The alternative is to work as a software engineer then transition to
a architectural role while beginning to delegate tasks to others. 

On the way back, he told me to look into the Peter Principle, which states

> People rise to their level of incompetence

The idea behind this is that people often look at who does well in their role for promotions. However as burdens increase, people become unable to perform at their current level
and no longer get promoted. At this level, they tend to fail which is why people seem to be inadequate for their roles.

> In order to put yourself in position for a role you want, you need to excel in the role you don't yet have... not only the one you're currently in - Daniel Hoffman

He also introduced me to the daily life of managers. As a software engineer, my typical day consists of taking issues that have been assigned to me and working them through.
I have complete control over when to work on what, and am solely responsible for my own performance. Meetings take a relatively small portion of my time. On the contrary for
a manager, his days are typically filled with meetings, scheduling and preparing for meetings, finding methods to redelegate tasks and leverage supply/demand of his team's time 
vs. what other teams want. He stressed the importance of simultaneously serving as a buffer for the team so they can work efficiently, and removing blockers for his team members
to proceed as efficiently as possible.

## Dee Horcasitas - Senior Technical Recruiter
Dee showed me that there are two sides to everything - just because I think getting opportunities and internships is extremely difficult, she has the opposite view. At any given point,
she has roughly 55 openings to fill, most of which with different managers and targeted skill sets. Although my experience is that there are far too many people with a scarce
job market, she finds that managers want all the best candidates working for low prices... yesterday. I also noticed that ironically, recruiters at top companies probably have 
the easiest time finding suitable candidates while theoretically also being the best recruiters. On the contrary, recruiters at lower level companies also have a smaller selection of candidates.

## John Poetzinger - Senior Storage Engineer
John was a software engineer who recently switched into management. He stressed the importance of networking, since managers typically look to people who are actively communicative
and open with the rest of the team. Additionally, he brought up a recent trend where people switch companies every few years, thus accelerating their promotion rate.

## Oliver Ratzesberger - EVP and Chief Project Officer 
Oliver is the presient of Teradata Labs and reports directly to Teradata's CEO, Victor Lund. With my newfound interest in management, I imagined his perspective would be
vastly different, since he has a higher level overview and greater influence on the company. My friends and I were astounded when he accepted, even building on our lunch offer by hosting catering
as well. To be continued after lunch on Monday.
