## Overview
Habits are important because they allow us to fundamentally change the way we live. Over time, we can apply
information gained to better streamline ourselves for reaching our goals. Having certain processes in place
makes picking up new habits and ensuring new habit quality simple.

## Useful Processes
Habits are difficult to acquire for several reasons. 

First, there are conflicting sources citing the length of time required for a repeated action to become
sufficiently ingrained such that it is a habit 
[https://examinedexistence.com/how-long-does-it-take-for-something-to-become-a-habit/](1), 
[https://www.brainpickings.org/2014/01/02/how-long-it-takes-to-form-a-new-habit/](2),
[https://www.amazon.com/Making-Habits-Breaking-Things-Change/dp/0306822628/?tag=braipick-20](3). 
For me, a habit is something I do without thinking
or consistently with infrequent compromise and ease.

Second, it is difficult to pinpoint when, exactly, a repeated action ceases to be a potential habit. This information is
helpful for deducing why this happened and how it might be prevented in the future. 

Third, understanding that a habit is indeed a good one and therefore worthwhile picking up is occasionally difficult.

Therefore to fix these, it is important to have

1. An evaluation process on whether or not a repeated action has become a habit (useful for estimating the rate at which
you may pick up new habits in the future); solves issue 1
2. A periodic check to (a) re-evaluate whether a repeated action is still worthwhile or (b) remind you to keep with
the potential habit; solves issue 2
3. A selection process for choosing new potential habits to minimize time wasted; solves issue 3

## Useful Tips/Tricks
1. If the habit you want to pick up has something you can log or is aesthetically pleasing, then you can accumulate
these to build up a record. Over time, losing the streak built in the record can incentivize you to continue
with the habit. A good example here is crossing off days that you've worked out on a visible calendar.
2. If you're susceptible to peer pressure and peer shame, then telling your friends may help to discourage yourself
from being a hypocrite.
3. Sharing the habit building process with friends/family and building them side by side may be helpful
for having someone else encourage you to keep it up.
4. Keep an easily visible checklist for when you need to do things/potential orderings.




































































































Many people base their happiness on 

Now that I'm done with school, I've often found myself thinking of how many positive impacts unique opportunities and people at Davis have had on me.

In all honesty, at the end of my first year at Davis, my typical day consisted of waking up at 1PM, 
eating some Party Pizza Tostitos, and playing games/watching movies until 6AM (sprinkled with occasional
assignments)... rinse and repeat. I'd done nothing, learned little, and thrown a year away. 

I thought to myself -- if I graduated like this, I'd never be able to forgive myself. 

Now although I haven't actually attended multiple universities, I imagine some of the experiences I have now
wouldn't have been possible elsewhere.

## Why Code Search is Important and useful
the same concept in a wide variety of ways to accomodate for everyone.

## Why Schools Should Teach Code Search
Research significantly changed my time at Davis. I was able to work on extremely interesting projects and narrow
in on my interests while playing around with various sub-fields of CS. Over the years, I co-created a visualization
method for dealing with large datasets with continuous variables, developed a tool to help Smart Contract developers
test their Solidity contracts, researched network anonymization flaws in today's industry, defended against 
heap memory attacks by randomizing malloc's header space, and created assignments for Davis's Computer Security
class.

Research allows you to work on interesting projects with a domain expert while exposing you to the edge of a field.
It is (hopefully) a perfect intersection of academics and application. Professors at Davis were readily
willing to advise me and connect me to others to further my development.

## Petitions
Petitions at Davis allow you to petition for anything. Keep in mind these have to be approved, but
they helped me immensely. Over the years, petitions helped me:
  * Substitute Biology for Chemistry
  * Complete my M.S. in 2 quarters. The required minimum residency is 3. 
  * Teach and research for units

## Notable Mentions
My time at Davis was substantially enhanced by the following people. I would be incredibly different today had I not met them.
  * Rylan Schaeffer
  * Prof. Matloff
  * Prof. Bishop
  * Davey Jay Belliss
  * Annie Tu
  * Vincent Yeh
  * Vishesh Mani, Howard Tan
