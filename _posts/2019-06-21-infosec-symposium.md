## Overview
I recently spoke at the [Davis Security Symposium](https://www.cvent.com/events/2019-information-security-symposium/custom-35-2bf6e0b8a1fd41a78a7211e81fcd1fd8.aspx?cpc=H7NM3FQB9TN) with my friend Harrison Nguyen
about [healthcare and blockchain](https://web.archive.org/web/20190624185212/https://www.cvent.com/events/2019-information-security-symposium/agenda-2bf6e0b8a1fd41a78a7211e81fcd1fd8.aspx?cpc=H7NM3FQB9TN).

Many people still don't understand how blockchain works even though there's many resources talking about how it fundamentally works. It's difficult to discuss further implications of this
technology with people don't have a strong understanding of its capabilities yet.

There's also quite a significant split between people who are in IT security and research security.
