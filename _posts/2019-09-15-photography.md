My brother Kevin is a fascinating man. I'll write a post about him another day, but he's become
a fantastic photographer. If you're interested, I'd highly recommend checking out [his work](http://akevinyang.com).

A few months ago, I was considering trying out new hobbies, so I reached out to my friend Annie. We were initially
planning on driving to some random mountain to try and take photos, but I mentioned this to 
Kevin who instantly shut it down.

Ouch.

Luckily he offered a solution. He whipped up several friends and proposed driving to Big Sur that night. Before long
we'd packed up some gear and food and were on our way down. 

Tons of tourists were there, but soon after sunset the winds whipped up and virtually everyone left. Photographers began
setting up their gear and Kevin drove around to explore several other nearby spots. 

He taught me several points. First, how to focus the camera at infinity and ensure that it'd capture the stars
without blur. Second, framing. He told me several other things but I'll be honest; I forgot them. Oof.

Anyway, by the end of the night I'd taken this picture:

"Beautiful", I thought. I've peaked; time to find a new hobby \s. 

I sent this to my family, and received "where was this?" and "wow crazy boys".

A few days later, my brother had finished editing, and sent:

I was blown away -- this was worlds different from what I'd taken, how was it possible????

Dad noted "Wow, this one is REALLY GOOD" haha
