## General Board Information
### Specs I've Locked Down
* Length: 147-149 (prefer 148 so far)
* Shape: ???
* Stiffness: Stiffer (more aggressive)
* Stance Width: 20-21 in
* Stance Placement: -5 +15 or -12 +12
* Directional or Twin
* Bindings: Flow
* Shoes: Burton Double Boa

### Boards Recommended for Me
* Rider's Choice Gnu (magnatraction; asymmetric; stiff flex)

### Previously Tried:

#### Upcoming: Burton StepOn

#### Lib Technologies Cold Brew 149 (2020?)
* Has magnatraction
* Reasonably capable of floating in powder (7, assuming Mind Expander is a 9).
* Caught much more edges, though this may be because I'm used to the Mind Expander.
* Reasonable for moguls/trees. Not great, but doable. (Slightly shorter would probably be better)
* Medium to high stiffness.
* Big snow day with low visibility, so hard to try at speed.

#### Jones Mind Expander 149 green (Womens)
* Used at 20 center to center, -5, 15
* Powder board with short effective edge
* Soft flex until back foot, then super stiff
* Easy to float. Directional, sits closer to the back.
* I felt I could reasonably carve, but it was really easy to turn.
* Would over-turn at high speeds unless I forced it to an edge.
* Powder House recommended a board that would be carve in more with higher flex for higher speed.
* Lots of hard snow this day, but technically this is my top speed board as of 1/29/2020 (48mph)

#### [Burton Process Flying V 148](https://www.evo.com/outlet/snowboards/burton-process-flying-v-snowboard-2017)
* Pretty good for riding fast.
* Good jumps, easy carves
* Started to jitter at high speeds
* Soft flex
* Used at 20 in center to center, -12+12
* Flying V is [Hybrid Rocker](https://snowboardingprofiles.com/understanding-the-different-snowboard-camber-types). 

#### [Burton Deja Vu Flying V 141](https://www.evo.com/outlet/snowboards/burton-deja-vu-flying-v-snowboard-womens)
* Extremely easy turns, but hard to stop/control.
* Serious flex
* Too short for me

### Burton Dragon 152
* Good for speed
* Hard to flex/do tricks (9 on stiffness scale) 
* Hard to carve on steeps.
* Faster edge to edge and faster turns due to camber + narrow sidecuts
* Too long for me

## General Board Info:
* Gnu has a cool feature called "magnatraction" (patented), which is a bunch of waves down the side of the board that make it better for icy conditions.
* Women's boards are typically narrower and have more flex. My boots are slightly wide, so that makes using it difficult.
* The Profile is the side view when you look down the side from the top.
* Burton is bad at the mix of camber/rocker edges, hence the "flying v" and such. GNU and one more brand (Lib Technologies?) are better for this.

## Tahoe Info
* [Weather/Road Conditions](http://tahoeroads.info/)
* [Bus 1: Tahoe Ski Trips](https://www.tahoeskitrips.net/)
* Bus 2: Sports Basement

## Bus Comparison
* SB has later pickup and arrives later. Usually after lifts are already running.
* SB has a bus per stop (no stops in between).
* SB is more likely to cancel due to bad weather. TST goes to many resorts.
* SB has good customer service.
* SB good for loading gear up; they do it for you.

## Good Places to Buy Boards
* Evo
* The House
* Backcountry
* Note: Some stores have exclusive boards, so it's hard to find retail. (Powder House ones should be findable online)

## Powder House Info
* Super cheap; highly recommend if at Heavenly
* Helpful people: Cory (Gondola)
* Helpful people: Nigel (green button) -- manager (Zalanta)
* Partnered with Tahoe Dave in North (you can return there)

## Riding Tips:
* Put the front strap around the front toe (instead of ontop)
  * Doesn't cut blood flow to toes
  * Presses your foot into the binding
  * Better for flipping onto heel edge

## Gear Tips:
* Stiff + long boards are bad, but I could probably ride a 151 stiff with more effective edge.
* Factory recommendation for distance between feet is "shoulder width", but 21 inches for men and 20 for women
* Boots wear in around 4 times from the heat of your foot. You can also ask shops to custom heat them for you.
* Today, you basically need an "entire arsenal".

## Goggles:
* People carry 2-3 pairs of goggles, one for each type of light.
* Don't let them get scratched.
* Some goggles have squeegees for goggles. Keep the inside of the goggles sealed; this helps the antifog.
* Some are even supposed to get you more light than you could get without goggles (Oakley high intensity yellow).
