Next board to try: Figure out if length really is the big factor, or if it was the hybrid rocker.

## Boards I've Used; My Sizing
* Snowboard size (cm): 144-152
* Snowboard width (mm): 246-250
* Current: Burton Dragon 152 (off Craigslist). Good for speed/stability, bad flex.
* 12/25/2019 at Whistler: Burton Deja Vu Flying V 141. Easy turns, hard to stop.
* 12/26/2019 at Whistler: Burton Process Flying V 148. Incredible for carving, good jumps, good flex.
* Flying V is [Hybrid Rocker](https://snowboardingprofiles.com/understanding-the-different-snowboard-camber-types). 
* Long boards are good for speed. Rocker camber rocker is okay at each. Short board with high flex is good for terrain park. Less flex is good for speed/stability.
