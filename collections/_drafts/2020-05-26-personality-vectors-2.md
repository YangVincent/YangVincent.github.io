### Overview
If you haven't yet read the first version, read [personality vectors]({{site.url}}/personality-vectors/).

This version establishes firm mathematical footing and is still very much in progress, especially since I haven't added LaTeX support.

Here's an unordered list of facts we care about.

* We want a finite number of possible interests. Otherwise the inner product between two vectors could be unbounded, which would be problematic. Otherwise, we need definite infinite.
* There's a precise term for this space of vectors, called L2-Space. "Interests are infinite-dimensional vectors living in the square-integrable L2 space"
* Square integrable means the Lebesque integral of the function squared is finite. If f is the function, I the interval and p(x)dx the probability measure,
f is square integrable if the integral over l of $$dx p(x) (f(x)^2) < infinity$$.


Here, have some $$\pi$$.

The greatest equation known to man is: 

$$e^{ix} = \cos{x} + i\sin{x}$$
