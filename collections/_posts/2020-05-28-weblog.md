### Weblog
Did you know blog is short for weblog? 

A lot of this page (and the blog category) are inspired by [Aaron Swartz](http://www.aaronsw.com/weblog/). It's
intended as a space for me to put miscellaneous thoughts into the void but not quite so far that I can't retrieve it on the fly.

More organized thoughts, guides, and links go in Resources, and explicitly written-for-public-consumption reads are under /stories.
