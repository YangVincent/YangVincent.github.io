I learned several interesting things from Rylan's dad today about biking (and from the ride in general)!
1. You want to keep your cadence around 80-100 rpm. Doing so allows you to burn different glycogen energy stores
that you've consumed, not stored. This allows you to use stored energy for "kicks" of speed later and releases slower lactic acid buildup.
2. He loves pacelines/drafting -- he and a few other guys can sustain 30+mph for hours; it allows him to save around 30% of his energy when drafting.
It's "the best feeling in the world", and obviously so. He's previously sustained multiple injuries and keeps coming back.
