I'm starting Whole 30 today with my brother. I'm fairly excited to see
1. How well we can keep each other consistent
2. How much closer we get
3. What foods I have a reaction to
4. How sustainable this is

We've roughly timed it to happen before Hawaii, but there're also other benefits. Angie mentioned that 
her focus and discipline changes based on food and that it's a good way to lead into discipline in other areas,
so I'm curious to see if I'll have similar effects. This post is here to help keep me accountable :D
