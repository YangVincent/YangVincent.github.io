My quarantine started with the abrupt end to my beloved ski season. One day I'm barreling down the mountains with snow spraying around me and the next
I'm leaving the Airbnb early to stock up on frozen dumplings for the imminent hunkering.

Quarantine devolved almost instantly into a monotonous rotation of dumplings, netflix, zoom. Pan-fry potstickers, watch some tigers, hop on another call. 
Restock the ling-lings, wonder about failed marriages, read about AES-128.

Thrown back into the college lifestyle with nothing to look forward to, my mind wandered aimlessly. 

Around a week in, I hit rock bottom. I'd open youtube just to close it because videos took too long to watch. Perhaps reddit? Nah,
there's too much reading. What if I listen to music? Sure, until I realize the blaring EDM I usually love sounds more annoying
than the birds crying outside my room at ungodly hours (6AM-9AM, in case you were wondering).

Desperate for a change of pace yet utterly incapable of relinquishing my security-oriented mindset, I identified 3 potential root causes: 
* Lack of exercise
* Lack of social interaction
* Lack of new experiences

Unfortunately, this knowledge is completely powerless under the
<a href="https://www.sccgov.org/sites/covid19/Pages/order-health-officer-033120.aspx" target="_blank">Santa Clara Health Order (3/31/2020)</a>
mandating continued shelter in place. ...unless?

<blockquote>
To engage in outdoor recreation activity, including, by way of example and without limitation, walking, hiking, bicycling, and running, in compliance with Social Distancing Requirements
</blockquote>

As if on cue, my phone chimes, "anyone want to go on a bike ride in SF?" 

I soon find myself huffing and puffing my way up Hawk Hill with two new friends Angela and Amy. 
A few minutes prior, Amy asked, "What bike is that?... I'm concerned Angela hasn't adequately prepared you for today's ride."

Emboldened by this challenge, I'm determined to keep up --- a goal soon replaced by another equally worthy goal: simply to make it up without falling off
my bike or stopping from exhaustion. It's important to teach your kids that yes, some dreams are meant to stay dreams. Sorry Shia.

I'm happy to announce I did indeed make it up that day, as well as many days following. It turns out biking is the simple solution for all 3 potential root causes and now, my outlook has improved significantly.

Today, my quarantine lifestyle is remarkably sustainable. Biking provides a way to spend time with friends, discover new terrain, and stay (or even get) in shape. 
My legs feel restless if I haven't ridden in a week. I've bought a new road bike so I can 
<a href="{{ site.url }}/stories/cycling-physics" target="_blank">stop holding others back</a> and I've met several incredibly fascinating people over a running total of 570+ miles. You know who you are.


I never expected to be the type of masochist who'd wake up at 6:30 AM for an hour drive just to grind my way up several thousand feet, but life's 
full of surprises. There's something immensely gratifying about working hard towards a goal with your friends while exploring our world.

As I was dripping sweat and creaking my bike the first time up the mountain, Angela was thinking about how a flat ride is a boring one --- "it has no personality".
Over many rides, I got faster and steadier, exploring the personality of the land. We rode through forests of towering redwoods, around neighborhoods filled with vested stock options, and
back and forth on the Golden Gate Bridge. We visited the beach, watched surfers, and wove through the myriad neighborhoods in SF in search for pupusas.
We lived life, even as the rest of the world was frozen.

Biking is a remarkable investment. According to my recent late-night youtube recommendations, every euro invested into cycling infrastructure has returned benefits 8 times 
over. It improves public health, public transport, and the planet's health. 

This month has been the best month in the history of bike shops for several Bay Area bike stores, with sales up 300%-400% nationwide. 
People, myself included, are starting to take notice. I hope this trend continues; biking, as a sport, deserves it.
