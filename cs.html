          <div class="details">
            <p>Before I begin, it's important to actually be in the right major to begin with. Too many people I know have spent several years in a major, then switched
            out - thereby having taken courses that (a) they aren't necessarily interested in and (b) are unlikely to help them later on in terms of breadth knowledge.
            If you are considering majoring in Computer Science, here are some factors to consider.</p>
            <p>Many people major in Computer Science for the money. Although this isn't a horrible reason, I honestly hope that these people have at least some interest
            in the subject. There are many different jobs that pay well - Truck Drivers make, as a national average, $73,000 which is enough for a solid standard of living
            throughout the majority of America. Furthermore, this doesn't require a college degree. Lawyers make on average $142,000, Sales managers make on average $114,000...
            the list goes on and on. There are also often better opportunities for advancement in fields such as Business. EY partners make an average of $650,000 a year, and it
            takes 15 years to hit this mark. Admittedly, some other majors also have less reliable work schedules but ultimately, I implore you to pick a major based off of more
            than mere salary. For instance, <a href="https://www.glassdoor.com/blog/11-jobs-pay-100k/">here</a> is a Glassdoor article on 11 jobs that have 100,000+ salaries. Majors and careers become exponentially easier when you are naturally passionate and curious of the topic. </p>
            <p>Simultaneously, people who are undeclared or considering switching majors are faced with a difficult problem - how do you choose a major you know little about? 
            I seek to illuminate common trends, benefits, and problems amongst Computer Science majors to help you with this choice. </p>
            <p>There are two big future career options to consider for Computer Science majors: Research and Workforce. Its difficult to identify the exact traits that push
            people towards research vs. the workforce, but typically the ones who go towards research push themselves to learn much more on the side, and are driven more by
            curiousity than a desire to boost their resume. However, it is difficult forthright to identify which would be better for you. As such, I strongly urge you to pursue
            Undergraduate Research. The benefits thereof are explained in a later section on this page. Next, for the workforce, it is important to understand the norms. Having
            an internship your Junior year summer is mandatory, and having summer internships for your Freshman and Sophomore years is highly recommended. All internships are paid,
            and the amount typically ranges from your standing in school. If you are a freshman, take any internship you can get. If you are a Sophomore, aim for the $18-$30 range,
            or even higher. If you're a Junior, aim for $25-$50 an hour. Large companies typically recruit in the fall, but the main recruiting season is
            Jan - April. For fulltime, your options depend on the track and area you are in, so it is difficult for me to make estimates.
            These specific numbers can be easily found with a quick google search. On occasion, part-time internship opportunities are also available during the school year. 
            Keep in mind this is rather difficult to get at Davis due to the low concentration of software companies in the area. Also, there are sometimes career fairs put on by
            the ICC (Internship Career Center) and by ASUCD for on-campus jobs. A lot of these have development opportunities, so I highly recommend trying to get experience through these
            especially since the extra bit of money is nice as well. The hardest one to get into is Creative Media, which works on very applicable/useful/interesting projects while simultaneously
            giving great experience. If you have the opportunity to join, definitely do so.</p>
            <p>Next, there is the mindset. Typically, Computer Science majors are extremely strong at critical reasoning, or should strive to be. This isn't to say that
            other majors don't rely on critical reasoning, but I know very few other majors that ask logic riddles as part of job interviews. Throughout my years in college,
            I have always encouraged: <b>Think of everything's purpose. Why is it the way it is? How would you make it? Why was it designed the way it is?</b> You'll
            find that thinking in this manner is incredibly helpful for learning new ideas and tools. </p>
            <p>Another important pattern I've noticed is that while people of other majors might stop and accept a program's weaknesses, (say for instance Microsoft Word,
            and its troublesome table customization), engineering majors typically look to create a better version themselves instead of relying on updates. Computer Science
            is a major of <b>creation</b>, you aren't just calculating debits/credits, or finding the time it takes for water to leave a system. You are building new tools
            that may improve peoples lives in the future.</p>
            <p>Finally, there is also 
            the social stigma that Computer Science majors are socially awkward and unathletic. Although I admit that there are many who are, this blanket statement is still
            far from the truth. Almost all tech companies have active athletic communities, and some of the best engineers I know have extensive social lives. Luckily, Computer
            Science also has a reputation for being a difficult major. I personally disagree, but having people respect your major is much nicer than having them disregard it
            altogether.</p>

            <p><b>Advice to Freshmen</b>: As a freshman you are brought into orientation and grouped with a group of other Computer Science majors, and
            put in contact with the head of Computer Science. At the time for me, it was Lori Avellar. During this time, they will give
            some extremely generic information, which I honestly didn't think helped at all. Here's what will.</p>
            <p>In the beginning, you are tasked to complete lower division requirements - ECS 30, 40, 50, 60, 20, MAT 21A, 21B, 21C, 22A,
            and the CHE2AB + BIS2A || CHE2ABC || PHYABCD + MAT21D. Unfortunately, calculus is relatively useless for many fields of Computer Science,
            but you have to take it regardless. I have found no way so far to get around this requirement. However, you can
            sub out CHE classes for BIS classes instead via. a petition. <a href="sci-petition">Here's how</a>. It is in your best interests to complete the lower division requirements ASAP. Rush to take 60, because
            this will secure job prospects. It is impossibly difficult to get a job without experience in data structures/algorithms. Be wary that 20 is a prerequisite,
            and plan to take this with 30 or 40. ECS 20 has no programming, but has a lot of discrete math and written homework/proofs. Also, check <a href="http://www.assist.org">assist.org</a>,
            since you can actually get past ECS 30 with this (though you can't with just APCS A). Alternatively, take ECS 30 for the easy A if you have experience. A note of caution: 
            ECS 30 uses C, which I heavily disagree with. However, be confident in memory management as well as basic control structures - if/else's, loops, functions. Stack overflow is your friend.</p>
            <p><b>Peer/CS Advising</b>: As 'prestigious' as peer advisors are, they don't always give great advice. You are often better off talking directly to Natasha, or reading up on the documentation yourself. If
            you think something should be changed/exist/not exist, talk to Natasha. Many things are undocumented (as I will elaborate on in other sections), but I find that peer advisors are only useful for (a) planning
            your courseload and (b) finding out about other majors/minors to consider (e.g. Tech Management).<br>
            As for counselor advising, (the adult staff), they are depressingly often unreliable as well. Several have a history of giving wrong advice, having the student complete the wrong requirements, then telling them 'oh that
            won't help you at all. You just wasted those units. Sucks.' For instance, I took ECS 30 which ended up getting me 0 units because I'd taken an equivalent course at Community College. Don't send in your transcripts unless you are
            100% sure there won't be repurcussions. Overall, try to only use staff advisors to help plan courses and learn about exceptions/tricks that can get you through the program. Keep in mind that they have low standards (don't expect
            students to have internships until junior year summer, and expect students to take no more than 4 classes a quarter). Personally, Natasha told me that I'd never be able to handle ECS 50 and 60 at the same time, since 60 is 'far too difficult'. 
            I severely regret listening to her; I wasted a quarter where I could have been progressing in my CS education, and did great in 60 with plenty of time on the side. Gauge difficulty by yourself and avoid doing so through the advisors. However,
            this is not for all cases - there are numerous edge cases in which advisors are extremely helpful. For instance, you cannot take STA 13 after having taking a higher level STA class... including ECS 132 which isn't in the stats department. When you
            must, get advice from Natasha, and run the advice by your friends. They might catch something she missed, and prevent you from completing a nonexistent requirement.</p>
            <p><b>Letters and Sciences Advising</b>: Letters and Sciences Advising is a hit or miss. Some advisors are great, others are horrible. If you don't get good help,
            try rescheduling for a different advisor. Advising is a great starting point, but a shitty finalizer. When deciding to declare my
            Econ double, they were extremely helpful in telling me about restrictions (only two upper-div courses can overlap/STA 131 counts for the STA Econ requirement), and planning out courses and professors. Another time, when figuring out transfer requirements, 
            the advisor knew only UC Reciprocity (which is the worst way to go), and was snarky/unhelpful/a general waste of time. Beware of the first office on the right, with the old blonde woman.</p>
            <p><b>Misc</b>: If you need to gauge the difficulty of a class, find their course site/past assignments, and try learning them. That is a better gauge than posting and asking other people who learn completely
            differently 'how hard is this class?' Also, other people have no idea if you will get off the waitlist or not. All you can do is figure out past drop-rates for a class, and the size of a class. Typically
            classes with over 150 people will let at least the first 30 people off the waitlist, whereas smaller classes might let around 10. There are exceptions (e.g. ECS 60 has a 33%-50% drop rate).</p>

            <p>As of 2015, Computer Science is an impacted major. This means that there is a 3.0 GPA requirement to declare. However, this can be circumvented. The requirement does not hold for double majors - if you declare another major m, then add CS as a double
            major, you can then drop m and be a CS major without needing the GPA requirement. The counselors are once again unreliable in the requirements here - you need to have ALL of your lower division courses done to declare (even as a double), not just 75%. Also,
            it is in your best interest to declare because it allows you to register for CS classes during Pass 1. If you are unable to get a class, email or visit the professor's office hours for a PTA - they'll often grant it. Alternatively, ask a few quarters ahead, and express
            interest in taking the class and your urgency. I've found that they're extremely accomodating and helpful (shoutout to Prof. Koehl).</p>

            <p>At UC Davis, there are several important tools to learn. The first is CSIF - these are a series of 64 bit computers running Fedora. They are rebooted every day at 2-3 AM, so save your work frequently. You can import your own configuration files, to make working on CSIF easier. You
            access these computers by sshing in. Always test your code on these computers. This is how your code will be graded. If it works on your computer but not csif, you have an extremely low chance of getting points back. Personally, I learned to use vim, since I have this rule where I minimize
            the amount of interaction I have with a mouse. For large projects, I download (sftp) code to my local computer, then load it into an IDE to use their debugger (personally, I used XCode though I also recommend CLion). Finally, with the project completed, I reupload to csif and check my code, then debug
            such that it works on their computers. If you just want a text editor, I recommend <a href="https://cyberduck.io">Cyberduck</a> - you can sftp your code to your computer, then when you save it'll reupload to csif where you can run code. Throughout, be sure to learn how to use a debugger. This is mandatory. It will help you greatly in the future,
            as opposed to printline debugging.</p>
            <p>Next, it is in your best interest to learn to use Github. 
            Version Control is essential in the workforce and also allows you to keep track of different versions of your code. Github has 3 main uses: First, to work on a project with a partner (think Google Docs but for code, and better). Second, you can just say 'go to this version 20ish minutes ago that worked' instead of
            ctrl+z'ing until you get somewhere close, or saving multiple backups. Finally, Github is essentially your resume/project portfolio as a CS major. Here's two good resources to learn Git: <a href="https://www.atlassian.com/git/">Atlassian's Guide</a> and <a href"//pcottle.github.io/learnGitBranching/?NODEMO">Git Features</a>.</p>
            <p>If you have a Mac, download <a href="http://brew.sh">Homebrew</a>. This is a package manager that basically manages everything you need for coding. Need a new version of python? 'brew upgrade python'. Need LaTeX? 'brew install latex'. Homebrew will be your best friend as you get used to using Terminal.</p>

          <div class="details">
            <p>For many courses, you will be allowed to have a partner. For these, I HIGHLY RECOMMEND finding someone who you believe to have the same skill as you, or potentially the same skill. During assignments, try to finish everything in the first two days on your own. This way, you learn everything and understand it all clearly. However,
            when you need to focus on other classes, you are able to do so since your partner will now pick up for you, since you did most of the work in the beginning. Also, since they are of relatively equal skill, you can trust them to finish. Don't pick someone much more skilled than you - you won't learn anything, and it'll hurt you later.
            If you are paired with a bad partner, get out ASAP as soon as you find a better partner.

            <p>At other universities, such as Berkeley, students are allowed to teach courses. There, they are called <a href="http://www.decal.org">DeCals</a>. Here, they are called the 98 series (<a href="http://www.cs.ucdavis.edu/blog/ecs-98-directed-group-study/">98</a>, <a href="http://www.cs.ucdavis.edu/blog/ecs-198-directed-group-study/">198</a>, 298). All you have to do to teach a class is (a) find a topic you are/can be knowledgeable about, that <b>isn't already taught</b>. (b) Find a professor passionate in the topic
            or who trusts you enough to back you up. Past professors work well for this. (c) Get approval from the committee. This stage takes a while, so ask the professor (Instructor of Record) and Natasha for advice. Your course will have to be approved through Academic Senate, which will take a long time. Constantly pressure them and follow up,
            to ensure your class's success. Teaching is one of the unique things Davis can give you; there are very few other places to experience this. Teaching allows you to be knowledgeable in a topic and practice public speaking, learn to communicate ideas more efficiently and clearly, and create many connections - through students as well as professors. 
            This often pays off in the future, since teaching your peers builds credibility for you, and professors have a great deal of references/resources that you could potentially benefit from. </p>

            <p>Senior Design is probably one of the most beneficial classes you can take at Davis. For this, you (and your group) are paired with a company, and
            complete a project for them over two quarters (2 units per quarter - <a href="http://www.cs.ucdavis.edu/blog/ecs-193a-senior-design-project/">ECS 193A and 193B</a>). It is helpful in giving real-world experience, creating something cool, and actually working on a large scale project with others - 
            something you don't have to do for any other class. Despite the title, you can take this class whenever - all you have to do is email the professor and convince her
            that you have sufficient knowledge and experience to contribute. <a href="http://web.cs.ucdavis.edu/~liu/">She</a> is extremely accomodating and understanding. If you fear that you don't have enough experience,
            offer to do the documentation and writeup. People typically avoid doing that, so you will still be able to contribute in a meaningful manner without coding. Unfortunately,
            this course can only be completed one time for credit but you can actually take the course multiple times, you just won't receive credit. This is helpful if you want to create
            more significant projects, but don't have ideas or a team.</p>

            <p>Undergraduate Research is something I recommend for everyone. As Computer Science majors, it is often in our best interests to work on side projects. However, it is often difficult to create a side project that stands out from everybody else's. Now, what if I told you you could (a) work on a side project that aligns with your interests with cutting-edge technology,
            (b) get advice and guidance from someone well versed in the field, and (c) get to know your professors which may help you for the integrated <a href="http://www.cs.ucdavis.edu/graduate/bs-ms-plan/">BS/MS</a> program, or getting a letter of recommendation for grad school, and finally (d) potentially get paid and/or published. One of my friends worked on controlling a hovercraft with looking at where it should be, another worked on a Machine Learning algorithm for code completion, another
            worked on a zero-day heap-overflow attack, another worked on security for SDN's, and another worked on an integrated online testing system. Research is a great way to rapidly learn and improve in your desired field while getting to know your professors, and getting units/salary. Unless you intend on pursuing further higher education, this is a fleeting opportunity you may never have again.</p>
            <p>If you are interested in research, first decide on a field you are potentially interested in. Then, look up the professors who work in/around that field. After, read some of their papers and project descriptions until you find a few you're potentially interested in. Finally, email the professor in hopes of being accepted to work on the project with them. You may have a higher chance of success if the research is with a professor
            you've had before. In your first meeting (during OH) or initial email request, communicate (a) your year/major and interest in the field, (b) your qualifications and work ethic, and (c) why you chose to email that professor in particular. <a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/daviscsclub/permalink/10153781535087758/">Here</a>'s a useful post from UC Davis's Computer Science club.

            <p>Tutoring is yet another great opportunity available in college. I categorize tutoring into two types. The first is ECS 197T, Tutoring for the Davis Computer Science Club. For this, you can get 1 unit for every 3 hours you tutor per week. Alternatively, if you have a strong/well-known reputation, students might come up to you and request private tutoring. This is the second type, and is in my honest opinion a much better use of time. 
            In my experience, students are willing to pay around $40 per hour, which is $80,000 a year. This is close to most Software Development jobs. Tutoring allows you to meet new people, build your reputation for future recommendations and/or referrals, allows you to practice communicating your ideas and knowledge, and lets you experience the joy of teaching. Many people find learning on their own extremely easy, and satisfying. Teaching is a whole new experience altogether. There is nothing quite like
            the feeling you get when you are able to clearly communicate an idea to a student who then applies this newfound knowledge and succeeds in doing so. I highly recommend tutoring for everyone.</p>

            <p>Internships are extremely important for your future career. Try to get one as early as possible. Start from <a href="https://icc.ucdavis.edu/find/resources/ajl.htm">aggiejoblink</a>, and work out towards job boards and companies you're interested in. I personally recommend using LinkedIn, Indeed, Glassdoor, and AngelList. Try to get as many interviews as possible for experience, even if you already have an offer. Also, read Cracking the Code. It will help immensely and is the current standard for
            interviews. Also, be sure to always ask questions at the end of your interview. Do your research beforehand and ask questions that demonstrate your preparation. Personally, if I'm out of ideas, I use something along the lines of 'what does success look like in this position', 'what are prospects for growth in this job', 'what are the most important skills for someone in this position'. Think out load to demonstrate your thinking process, but also don't just say everything that comes
            to mind. If you can't find opportunities from job boards, reach out to friends and family. This is likely the most efficient way of job hunting. Finally, the big companies typically recruit around fall while the majority recruit around January to March. Don't miss these time frames. Finally, for your resume, add projects involving data structures and algorithms, and elaborate in the form 'implemented x through using y to achieve z'. For example, 'Implemented an efficient electrical distribution system using Ford-Fulkerson to achieve a 38% increase
            in performance'. Good luck!</p>
