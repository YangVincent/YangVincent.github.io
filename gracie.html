    Qualifications:
    </h7>
    <p>
        For each grade level, they expect some level of competency. This is why it is
        in your interests to do apply as early as possible, unless you are actually gaining 
        more experience during whatever time it is. For instance, they will expect a better
        resume from someone who is a 4th year as opposed to someone who is a first year.

    <h7>Social Competency</h7>
    <p>
        Social Competency is incredibly important. Social interactions are probably the biggest
        aspect of business or even professionalism, which is what AKPsi focuses on. As a result,
        if you do not get along well or if they deem you as not socially competent, this will
        drastically lower your odds of getting a bid. 
        Elaboration:
        Furthermore, it is important to be subtle in how you are better than everyone else.
        Understand what they are looking for and what they lack, but also recognize their strengths.
        For example, do not try and correct them, or act like you know more than them about the Fraternity
        even if you do. This will leave a sour taste in their mouth, and is also a little offputting.
        For instance, if you know that they don't have Psych majors and want them to diversify, don't tell
        them that you know they need you because it comes off as pretentious. Rather, mention it subtly - 
        "I'm particularly interested in joining Alpha Kappa Psi because I believe being around so many similarly
        driven people would be a great motivator in pushing me to work harder. I was looking on the website the other
        day and found that many Brothers have similar interests, so I believe I would be able to actively contribute
        to the brotherhood while simultaneously being pushed to improve"
