# About 

Welcome to my website! I am a third year undergraduate at the [University of California, Davis](https://www.ucdavis.edu/). My primary interests are in Computer Security, Machine Learning, and Web Development.

---

I recently co-taught an upper division undergraduate course on [Cryptocurrency Technologies](http://rylanschaeffer.github.io/resources/198FCourseSyllabus.pdf) with
[Rylan Schaeffer](https://www.linkedin.com/in/rylanschaeffer) under [Karl Levitt](http://faculty.engineering.ucdavis.edu/levitt/). 9 of 23 students submitted [evaluations](https://yangvincent.github.io/resources/eval.pdf).
Labs, lectures, and assignments may be posted at a later date.

I am also involved in undergraduate research in Computer Security for Professor [Matt Bishop](http://nob.cs.ucdavis.edu/~bishop/) under the College of Engineering, as well
as the Continuous Integration/DevOps Intern at [Teradata](http://www.teradata.com/?LangType=1033). 

On the side, I am the Director of Technology for [Delta Sigma Pi | Nu Rho](https://www.dsp-nurho.com) at UC Davis, Webmaster for TEDxUCDavis, a private tutor for the Davis Computer Science Club, and a
Consultant for Davis Consulting Group.

In my free time, I enjoy snowboarding, listening to music, and trying new foods.
