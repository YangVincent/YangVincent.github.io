I co-taught an upper division undergraduate course on [Cryptocurrency Technologies](http://rylanschaeffer.github.io/resources/198FCourseSyllabus.pdf) with
[Rylan Schaeffer](https://www.linkedin.com/in/rylanschaeffer) under [Karl Levitt](http://faculty.engineering.ucdavis.edu/levitt/). 9 of 23 students submitted [evaluations](https://yangvincent.github.io/VincentECS198F.pdf).

I am also involved in undergraduate research in Computer Security for Professor [Matt Bishop](http://nob.cs.ucdavis.edu/~bishop/) under the College of Engineering, as well
as the Continuous Integration/DevOps Intern at [Teradata](http://www.teradata.com/?LangType=1033).
