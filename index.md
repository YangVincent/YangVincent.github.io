# Welcome!

I'm a Software Engineer at [Google](https://security.googleblog.com/) who enjoys
[snowboarding](https://www.yangvincent.com/snowboarding-gear), playing [badminton](https://www.yangvincent.com/badminton), listening to music, and [reading](https://www.goodreads.com/vincentyang).

I'm fascinated by our raisons d'Ãªtre and how we may best fulfill them.

I also care about [Security](https://security.googleblog.com/), [Blockchain](https://www.yangvincent.com/infosec-symposium), and [Optimizing Developer Efficiency](https://github.com/YangVincent/dotfiles) and did so previously at
[UC Davis](https://www.cs.ucdavis.edu) for my [BS](https://github.com/RylanSchaeffer/ecs198-cryptocurrency-technologies) & [MS](https://arxiv.org/abs/1709.00665), [NIST](https://www.nist.gov), [Course Hero](https://www.coursehero.com), [Teradata](https://www.teradata.com), and [IdentityMind Global](https://www.identitymindglobal.com).
