            <p>Petitioning is a method you can use to get past or waive requirements such as having too many units,
            extending incomplete grade deadlines, declaring major/minors, late dropping or adding a class, receiving
            credit for a graduate/teaching course, and more. A more comprehensive list of resources can be found online.
            <br/>A good friend of mine, Rylan Schaeffer, told me when he was a senior about a time when he was a first year - someone
            told him, "petition everything". He was able to get past several requirements because when he reached a class that had
            repeated material or irrelevant topics, he petitioned and didn't take no for an answer, at least not at first. I'm now passing this on to you. 
            <br/>For the Chemistry 2 series, there exists a petition that lets you substitute a class for another. So far,
            I've been unable to find a way to completely waive a class, but I have been able to swap Chemistry 2B (CHE 2B) for
            Biology 2B (BIS 2B).</p>

            <p>If you find more interest in taking one class over another, maybe because you have little/no interest
            in a required class and would rather make better use of your time and units, then you should petition.
            It requires minimal effort (just sending a few emails), and can be extremely helpful. Personally, I swapped out
            Chemistry for Biology, which allows me to work toward the Bioinformatics minor while simultaneously fulfilling requirements
            for my Computer Science major.</p>

            <p>A successful petition identifies the reasons a class exists - maybe it is important for some aspect of the major or useful general knowledge.
            If the purpose of a class is ambiguous or unidentifiable, I recommend asking faculty. This greatly helps your case. After doing so, email your advisor.
            For me, it was Natasha Coulter. They will be of great aid in helping your petition succeed, since they actually fill out the form and pass it on to the 
            relevant people for you. Once again, petitioning really takes minimal work.</p>

            <p>No matter how hard I tried, I could not find a good reason for Computer Science majors to take Chemistry, except that many people found it to be easier
            than Biology. Personally, I didn't agree so I often asked professors, lecturers, and faculty about their opinions of Chemistry and Computer Science. Two professors'
            responses stuck out to me. The first is Patrice Koehl, the second is John Owens. Prof. Koehl spoke on how students such as himself often realized how Chemistry
            is all around us, and helps students understand that basic building blocks can be used to create many different varying results. Personally, I think this is pretty
            obvious and requiring a class to teach this concept is overkill, but to each his own. He also added the extra detail that this requires the Chemistry professor 
            to be a 'good teacher' which unfortunately, isn't an accurate description of several Che professors. Meanwhile, my conversation with John Owens was more
            frustrating, but ultimately more helpful in helping me not take Chemistry. During a meeting in which Computer Science students could give feedback for the department,
            I asked about Chemistry as a requirement. He answered that the reason Davis is significant is that it is a research university, as opposed to a trade school.
            He continued, (roughly paraphrased), "We want your Bachelor's degree from Davis, a research university, to mean something. Your degree shows that you have received
            a university-level education in Science". Personally, I have several problems with this such as (a) Economics majors aren't required to take science, so how about the other
            B.S. degrees - do they not mean something? (b) I don't think employers are looking for degrees in Computer Science to ensure the student has learned Chemistry, 
            and (c) there are easier university-level classes in Science (ex: Bis 10), or even just the Bis 2x series. Why don't these count?</p>
            <p>Luckily, I was able to use exactly this viewpoint to swap out Che 2b for Bis 2b. As further research, I found that Biology helps with leading into
            Bioinformatics, which is related to Computer Science while Chemistry has no similar major linking to Computer Science. Also, I realized I could argue that
            the core classes (the 2 series for Bis and Che) should both be of similar difficulty. On top of that, the 'middle' class of each series should be of
            roughly the same difficulty... right? Although I used this as part of my argument, Bis 2b (Evolution/Ecology) is popularly known as the easiest of the series, while Che 2b (Acid Base Chem)
            is known as the hardest of the series.</p>
            <p>After gaining this information, I emailed Natasha asking about the process overall. The email chain is <a href="images/che2b-petition.pdf" target="_blank">attached</a>. Don't forget
            to scroll from bottom up, because it is in reverse chronological order. The final petitioning form is <a href="images/che2b-petition2.pdf" target="_blank">attached here</a>.</p>
            <p>Recently, several people have contacted me and drafted similar emails to Natasha, ultimately successfully swapping out Che 2b for Bis 2b. If you have more
            interest in Biology than Chemistry, I highly recommend petitioning. Good luck!</p>
